# Stack

The stack object provides flow and rhythm between direct sibling elements. Where --flow-space is not defined: the default value is 500 on the size scale.

This means that direct siblings inside of the `.o-stack` utility will have a margin-top of `1.25 rem`.

By defining `--stack-space` in the CSS of either a child element of `.o-stack`, or on `.o-stack` itself: that value will be honoured in line with the cascade and specificity.
